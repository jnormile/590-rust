# Chapter Zero


## The Golden Circle

In 2009, Simon Sinek's [Start With Why](https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/) hit bookshelves and started encouraging aspiring leaders to leverage the "golden circle" to better inspire those who might follow them. This golden circle is a three circle bullseye, with the question "What?" inhabiting the outermost ring, its cousin "How?" taking up the second ring, and the all-important "Why?" squarely situated in the innermost circle, or the *bullseye*. The idea (as I remember it, anyway) is to inspire prospective followers by starting with that center circle--which often encapsulates a vision or a motivation--and then working your way towards the outer two rings in succession: first *why*, then *how*, and finally *what*.

A couple years after it's publication, I would *devour* this book as one of those aspiring leaders myself (I once thought that pastoral ministry might be for me) only to gradually forget 99% of the book's contents over the course of the decade that followed.

But I never forgot about that golden circle.


## *Why?*

So, an important question--why should you care about any of that? That some guy read a leadership book over ten years ago and mostly forgot what it was about? Wasn't this going to be about Rust, anyway?

Two reasons for sharing the golden circle:

1. That you might understand my own reasoning for focusing on specific parts of the "story" behind Rust--at least to *start*

2. To provide purely anecdotal evidence of the power of a compelling visual

Let's examine these justifications just a little further.


## Why *Rust?*

Rust--the programming language--is not a naturally occurring phenomenon. It's not like its biological namesake ([a type of fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(fungus))) or what people often assume to be its nomenclative inspiration ([the iron-oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust)) in that it just *exists* independent of us. It was first created by a person--one Graydon Hoare--for a *reason*.

This document/blog/journal/whatever will begin with an exploration into that reason--or reason**s**, as it's likely to be. Writing a programming language is not a particularly quick or easy task: work on Rust began in 2006 and the first stable release didn't find its way into the wild until 2015, a whopping nine years later (or about the time it takes to forget 99% of a book).

Why did anyone bother to create Rust in the first place? What could motivate someone to work on something for so long when programming languages abound around us?

Whatever Hoare's reasons for first setting out to create and implement the language, there's no doubt that it was a fruitful endeavor. The results from Stack Overflow's annual developer survey indicate that [86.73% of developers love Rust](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted), making it the *most* loved language in 2022.

Why does the developer community love it so? I suspect there's an intersection in the motivations for both designing and actually using the language--something we'll hopefully discover together.


## Why *(Comma)* Rust?

Interestingly, the Stack Overflow survey also unearthed some seemingly contradictory findings. In spite of it sitting atop a throne of love, an incredibly underwhelming [9.32% of developers actually *use* Rust](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-popular-technologies). This encompasses professional and educational contexts--does that mean Rust is purely a *hobby* language? Is it perhaps so beloved *because* nobody's actually using it, getting to know it intimately enough to see all the warts and wrinkles that keep it from being more widely used? Is it (perhaps more likely) just because the language is so *new?*

This is but one of many mysteries surrounding the language. As we entertain the question of "Why Rust?" we'll also entertain the question of *"Why, Rust?"* The language has a certain reputation for having a steep on-boarding ramp--in my own experience I've met more individuals who would like to "get around" to learning Rust someday than those who actually *use* the language in their own work.

"Why you gotta' be like that, Rust?" we'll ask, together. Perhaps, if we're equal parts lucky and persistent, we'll learn something along the way.


## The Golden Gears

You'll recall that I brought up the golden circle for *two* reasons, the second of which being to provide (completely personal) evidence that pictures have a certain staying power. It's with this in mind that I close this introduction with another picture, one inspired by both the golden circle as well as [Rust's gear-shaped logo](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

**TODO: GOLDEN GEARS DIAGRAM HERE**

The golden gears pictured above illustrate the overall intent and flow of this journey we're embarking on. By starting with *why*, I hope that the work will help "power" subsequent explorations into questions concerning the *how* and *what* of Rust. For instance, if we know *why* Rust opts to use an ownership system for memory management, we might glean insights into *how* to most effectively use it. If we know *how* to effectively make the most of one of Rust's systems, that should be incredibly helpful in determining *what* is best built with it.


## On Optimism

A final note: if you feel like I use a lot of *might*s, *should*s, and *hope*s, that's because I *do*. This document/exploration/indulgence/whatever is an optimistic voyage into the largely unknown. I personally have *very* little firsthand experience with Rust, and am by no means an established developer--I wrote my first lines of code in Python less than two years ago. But it's my *hope* that my own grapples with the language--both in terms of the technical as well as the more abstract--are illuminating.

I may be undeservedly optimistic about the fruits of this labor, but to close with another cherry-picked gem from our friend Simon Sinek, ["The primary ingredient for progress is optimism."](https://twitter.com/simonsinek/status/1461705827560136707)
